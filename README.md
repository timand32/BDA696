I tried the following starting pitcher stats (100-day stats and prior career stats):

1. IP (Innings Played)
2. GS (Games Started)
3. S9 (Strikeouts per 9 innings pitched)
4. H9 (Hits per 9 innings pitched)
5. H9 (Home runs per 9 innings pitched)
6. IP Ratio (home starting pitcher's IP/away starting pitcher's IP)

The following was used for the rest:

home starting pitcher's stat - away starting pitcher's stat
